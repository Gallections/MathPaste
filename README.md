## Functional Requirements:
1. provide a version that gives you the unwrapped latex version. (done)
2. make a keyboard shortcut in GPT that allows you to enable the extension (Ctrl + M) (done)


## UI requirements:
1. We need a top layer UI that pops up when the user first launch the chrome extension.
2. Ideally we also need some kind of interactive UI on the side that is collapsible.


## Additional Considerations:
1. auto-launch.
2. Cache.
3. Auto math equation detection from the page.
